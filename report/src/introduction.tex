\section{Introduction}
The Kuramoto-Sivashinksy equation describes a falling liquid film. It is a nonlinear PDE for the velocity $u$ at the surface of the liquid and in the following we will consider a one-dimensional system.

The equation shows two regimes for periodic boundary conditions, a stationary one and a turbulent one. There will be a special consideration of the numerical simulation for the turbulent regime.
