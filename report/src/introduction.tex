\section{Introduction}
The Kuramoto-Sivashinksy equation describes a falling liquid film. It is a nonlinear PDE for the velocity $u$ at the surface. In the following we will consider a one-dimensional system.

The Kuramoto-Sivashinksy equation shows two regimes, a stationary one and a turbulent one. We will take a special look at the numerical simulation of the system for the turbulent regime.
